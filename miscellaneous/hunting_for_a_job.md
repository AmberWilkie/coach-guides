### Preparing for an interview
Below is a list of ruby interview questions that you should run through before your upcoming developer interview to get your mind running.

 **This list is by no means exhaustive, and prospective employees should be prepared to handle much more complex questions and exercises than these.**

Remember that the best interview questions are open ended and have no definitive answers –  a  good interviewer knows this and will be looking for your thought process and problem solving skills, rather than the ‘correct’ answer.

That being said, there are still some straight forward questions that any Rails programmer should be able to answer and discuss.  Many of these questions are relatively simple but being able to explain them in plain english may be more difficult than you think.

To quote Albert Einstein, *‘If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough’*
