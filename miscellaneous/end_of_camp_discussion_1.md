## The Bootcamp experience

1. General thoughts about the Bootcamp.

2. In what way has your interpersonal skills been challenged and what do you take away from the camp?

3. What are your thoughts about the challenge based curriculum and in what way will that way of learning impact your professional future?


### Assignments until next session
1. Go over the curriculum and reflect on your own performance but also try to ’see’ the common thread of the challenges we introduce over time. Why are we introducing certain things at any given week? Write down a list of all the different technologies, workflows and practices. Reflect about how confident you are with each one on a grade from 1 to 10. The idea is that we discuss this in tomorrows session.

2. Write a draft of an introduction letter that you can use in your job hunting process. If you don’t feel confident sharing that with the team, you don’t have to. But please share it with me and I will make sure that you get some professional feedback. This is the first step in creating a ’selling’ CV for you.
